Milestone 2: Week 3–4 
• Implement text extraction module for parsing downloaded PDFs. 
• Extract section-wise text data and store it for analysis. 
• Develop key-finding extraction logic and cross-paper comparison module. 
• Validate correctness and completeness of extracted textual data. 

1️- PDF Text Extraction
Purpose
Extract readable text from downloaded research PDFs.
Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for reliable text extraction
Uses pymupdf4llm for layout-aware extraction when available
Automatically skips restricted or corrupted PDFs


2️-Text Cleaning & Preprocessing
Purpose
Remove noise introduced by PDF formatting.



3️- Robust Section-Wise Extraction ⭐ (Major Enhancement)
Purpose
Automatically identify academic sections.
Sections Extracted
Title
Abstract
Introduction
Methods
Results
Conclusion
References



4️- Key-Finding Extraction ⭐
Purpose
Automatically extract important concepts from each paper.


5️- Validation of Extracted Data ⭐
Purpose
Ensure correctness and completeness.
Validation Checks
Abstract exists
Methods section exists
Results section exists
Text length is sufficient

6️- Cross-Paper Comparison Module ⭐
Purpose
Compare research papers based on textual similarity.
Metrics Used
Cosine Similarity (TF-IDF based)
Keyword Overlap Ratio


keyword_overlap(k1, k2)
