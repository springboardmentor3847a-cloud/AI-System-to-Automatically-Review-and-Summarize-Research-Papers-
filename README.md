Gradio (UI)

JSON-based modular pipeline

🗓️ Milestones Covered
✅ Milestone 1: Paper Retrieval

✅ Milestone 2: PDF Extraction & Analysis

✅ Milestone 3: Draft Generation & Synthesis

✅ Milestone 4: Review, Refinement & Final Report

⚠️ UI Note

The Gradio interface is fully implemented but intended for local execution.
Due to Python 3.12 and uvicorn limitations in Google Colab, UI execution in Colab may be unstable. The core AI pipeline runs successfully.📄 Output
